    "Ans:-In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When a Python script encounters a situation it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. Exceptions are Python objects that represent errors. They are used to handle various types of errors that can occur during program execution.\n",

All exceptions other than Runtime Exceptions are known as Checked exceptions, and if these exceptions are not handled/declared in the program, you will get a compilation error. However, implementing exception handling will give a workaround in which the rest of the program is executed if they are independent with respect to the exception incurred."
